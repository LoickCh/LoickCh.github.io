**Academic cursus**: 
* 2016-2018: Two intensive preparatory classes at the Lycée Henri IV, in France. 
* 2018-2022: Fours years at Ecole Nationale des Ponts where I studied mathematics and informatic with a focus on probability and statistics. During my second year of engineering school, I did a 6-month Erasmus exchange in Milan at Politecnico di Milano where I discovered machine learning.
