Hello, I’m Loïck, a deep learning Master student. I have just finished the Master of computer science (MVA) of ENS Paris-Saclay and I am currently working at Valeo AI as a Deep Learning Research intern.

I am looking for an internship to validate my engineering school and I would like to continue in thesis in a deep learning related field.
