I’m Loïck, a Master student in the field of computer vision / machine learning. I have just finished the Master CS. MVA of ENS Paris-Saclay.

**Biography**: I studied mathematics for two intensive years in preparatory classes at the Lycée Henri IV, in France. Then I entered the Ecole Nationale des Ponts where I studied mathematics and informatic with a focus on probability and statistics. During my second year of engineering school, I did a 6-month Erasmus exchange in Milan at Politecnico di Milano where I discovered machine learning. Because of my interest in machine learning, I then applied for the MVA Master's degree at ENS Saclay. To validate my master, I am currently doing an internship at Valeo AI in computer vision. For next year, I am looking for a PhD.
